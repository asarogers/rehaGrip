## Overview

RehaGrip is a lightweight, motor-driven orthotic for hand rehabilitation, designed to help **stroke patients** re-train finger extension movements.  
A **Dynamixel servo** powers a swing-arm platform that gently opens the userâ€™s fingers with adjustable angles, velocity, and presets.  
The system now features a **FastAPI backend** and **React-based GUI** for precise, repeatable, and safe motor control.

## Core Features

- **Motor Control**
  - Move to a target angle in degrees with optional velocity control.
  - Set and recenter the middle position.
  - Switch between **left-hand** and **right-hand** mode.
  - Enable/disable torque for free rotation.
  - Lock motor via software to prevent accidental movement.
- **State Tracking**
  - Get position (ticks & degrees), load, movement state, torque, and emergency status.
  - Display movement limits based on current center.
- **Presets**
  - Save, load, and reload position presets from JSON.
  - Built-in default presets for quick setup.
- **Emergency Handling**
  - Emergency stop for instant torque cutoff.
  - Resume operation after clearing emergency state.
- **React GUI**
  - Live motor status updates.
  - Preset editing and saving.
  - Incremental position control buttons.
  - Velocity slider.
  - Emergency stop toggle.
  - Hand mode switching.

## Backend API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `http://<host>:3001/api/motor`

| Endpoint                   | Method | Description |
|----------------------------|--------|-------------|
| `/move`                    | POST   | Move motor to a target position (degrees) with optional velocity. |
| `/status`                  | GET    | Get current motor state (position, load, movement, torque, etc.). |
| `/center`                  | POST   | Set current position as the center. |
| `/recenter`                | POST   | Move to middle of range and set as center. |
| `/hand`                    | POST   | Switch between left or right hand mode. |
| `/lock`                    | POST   | Lock or unlock motor movement. |
| `/torque`                  | POST   | Enable or disable motor torque. |
| `/emergency`               | POST   | Engage or disengage emergency stop. |
| `/presets`                 | GET    | Get saved position presets. |
| `/presets`                 | POST   | Save updated position presets. |
| `/presets/reload`          | POST   | Reload presets from file. |

## How It Works

RehaGrip uses a **Dynamixel XL430-W250-T servo** to control a swing arm that lifts the hand platform.  
All motion is handled in **current-based position control mode** for smooth, safe operation.  
The Python backend communicates with the motor over USB serial, while the React GUI interacts with the backend via REST API calls.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Proposal

> **Title:** Development of a Hand Orthotic Device for Stroke Research  
> **Location:** Northwestern University, Department of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences  
> **Mentors:** Ahalya Mandana & Dr. Ana Maria Acosta  
>  
> **Objectives:**  
> - Apply finger extension forces with minimal weight on the hand.  
> - Allow voluntary finger flexion and thumb pinch.  
> - Prioritize comfort, easy donning/doffing, and modularity.  
>  
> **Deliverables:**  
> - Functional motorized prototype.  
> - API for research integration.
